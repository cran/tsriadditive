Description: Additive hazards models with two stage residual inclusion method are fitted under either survival data or competing risks data. The estimator incorporates an instrumental variable and therefore can recover causal estimand in the presence of unmeasured confounding under some assumptions. A.Ying, R. Xu and J. Murphy.
